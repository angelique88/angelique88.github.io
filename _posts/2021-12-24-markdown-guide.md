## Collaborative Discussion #1

Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), in the context of the article by
Huxley et al (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with
such a large-scale process of data collection.


WEEK 1

The Internet of Things (IoT) has benefited society through greater convenience and connectivity across
all different aspects of life. Naturally, the rise in the number of connected devices brings opportunities
such as a greater volume of consumer data to analyze, and challenges including processing large data
streams in real time (Tajeda, 2023).

IoT has become widespread as it enables companies to automate processes and reduce labor costs
(M,2019). Having a device complete traditionally manual tasks can achieve this. Devices can increasingly
operate on their own with little need for human intervention (M,2019). With IoT, companies can also
collect more data and track more things, allowing them to make better decisions. The opportunities that
IoT and big data bring to companies are evidently endless, leading to happier customers and businesses.
However, a limitation of IoT for companies would be the technical complexities that exist in big data
architecture. Comparisons between Lambda vs Kappa architecture and how they tackle some of these
issues will be discussed. Lambda architecture allows all data flowing in to go through either the batch
layer or speed layer to reduce the problem of latency (Tajeda, 2023). If querying data takes several
hours to carry out, the results may become old. Nonetheless, there are still downfalls to lambda
architecture with the main one being the tradeoff between latency and accuracy. With two paths for
data to choose from, this creates another issue, complexity (Tajeda, 2023). This leads to duplicate
computation logic when it comes to managing both paths. On the contrary, Kappa architecture has been
developed with a single path using a stream processing system to mitigate the complexities (Tajeda,
2023).

A risk posed would be security and privacy for users of IoT products. IoT systems are interconnected on
multiple networks, resulting in vulnerability over how data spreads and making network attacks more
common (Prasanna, 2022). IoT devices also collects users’ personal details for the products to serve
them better. This leads to users having fears over how their data is handled by companies and who has
access to such data. Thus, large-scale data collection presents a handful of disadvantages as well,
especially if mishandled.

Lastly, with so much data collected by companies, it is vital they are cleaned properly to allow for
accurate analysis. Data cleaning presents yet another challenge in IoT. In the error detection stage,
duplicate cases, missing values, and extreme scores are all examples of inaccurate data that must be
flagged and handled accordingly (Huxley, 2020). Dealing with messy or inaccurate data is common in big
data and processes need to be put in place that enable researchers to clean each data set and ensure
they are double-checked before the data analysis process. It is pointless to have so much data collected
if what is being analyzed is wrong as it will only lead to false conclusions and poor decisions down the
line.
To conclude, IoT and mass data collection presents society with a myriad of opportunities and
challenges. If companies ensure the right processes and standards are put in place, we can enjoy the
benefits while minimizing the risks of large-scale data collection.

Week 3
One of the main points of discussion within my post was the tradeoff between IoT convenience, privacy,
and safety. While many companies benefit from collecting customer data, customers are constantly at
risk of how their data is being managed and shared. In one experiment, researchers hacked a Tesla
Model S via the car’s entertainment system and were able to take control over the car lock, hand brake,
and touch screen (Thomas, 2016). Although this may be an extreme example of the threats posed by IoT
devices, the example still demonstrates how many of the devices we use daily warrants entry to our
networks of data. Similarly, wearable technology are huge collectors of private data and developers of
these devices may not always be prioritizing security and privacy as driving profits are the goals for most
companies (McBride, 2016). Evidently, mass data collection resulting from a rise in the IoT space will
bring more disadvantages if standards are not implemented. One of my classmates mentioned the
technical complexities of big data architectures would increase if strong encryption was implemented
(Bertino, 2016). They also suggested new features such as anonymization, implementing the right to be
forgotten, implementing the right to object, etc would have to be put in place which would expend a lot
of time and resources (EU, 2016, Articles 12-22). While this may be true, if society is going to embed
something so powerful such as IoT into our daily lives, we have the duty to ensure everyone is kept safe.

Another point around data cleansing of mass data was raise by a classmate. With so much data flowing
in each second, it is difficult to clean in real time so it can be used for analysis immediately. However as
mentioned in my previous post, Kappa architecture has been developed with a single path using a
stream processing system to mitigate the complexities and issue of latency (Tajeda, 2023). As the tech
landscape continues to evolve, better packages for data cleaning will also be developed for widespread
use. Additionally, using different tools, companies can set up pre-defined cleansing routines and
standardization rules to further speed up the data cleansing process (Sheikh, 2022). There is plenty of
opportunities and methods to allow for companies to explore and discover what works best for their
data cleansing routine.
